    <p style="padding: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5; color: rgb(1, 31, 21);">The word solar means "pertaining to the Sun", 
        which is derived from the Latin word sol, meaning Sun.
        The Sun is the dominant gravitational member of the Solar System, 
        and its planetary system is maintained in a relatively stable, slowly evolving state by following isolated,
         gravitationally bound orbits around the Sun.
        <br/>
        The four terrestrial or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, few or no moons, and no ring systems. 
        They are composed largely of refractory minerals such as the silicates—which form their crusts and 
        mantles—and metals such as iron and nickel which form their cores. Three of the four inner planets 
        (Venus, Earth and Mars) have atmospheres substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters 
        and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and volcanoes. The term inner planet should not be 
        confused with inferior planet, which designates those planets that are closer to the Sun than Earth is 
        (i.e. Mercury and Venus).

        <h2>Asteroid groups</h2>
        <p>Asteroids in the asteroid belt are divided into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital 
            characteristics. Kirkwood gaps are sharp dips in the distribution of asteroid orbits that correspond 
            to orbital resonances with Jupiter.[121] Asteroid moons are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids.
             They are not as clearly distinguished as planetary moons, sometimes being almost as large as their 
             partners (e.g. that of 90 Antiope). The asteroid belt includes main-belt comets, which may have 
             been the source of Earth's water.</p>
