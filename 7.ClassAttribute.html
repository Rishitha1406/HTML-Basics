            <h2>Mercury</h2>
            <img class="planet-image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Mercury_in_true_color.jpg/220px-Mercury_in_true_color.jpg" alt="Mercury">
            <p class="planet-desc">Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and the smallest planet in the solar system â€” it is only 
                a little larger than Earth's moon. Mercury zips around the sun in only 88 days and because it is 
                so close to our star (about two-fifths the distance between Earth and the sun).
                <br/>
                Mercury experiences dramatic changes in its day and night temperatures. 
                Mercury temperatures can reach a scorching 840 F (450 C) in the day, which is hot enough to melt lead.
                Meanwhile, on the night side, temperatures drop to minus 290 F (minus 180 C).  </p>

            <h2>Venus</h2>
            <img class="planet-image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Venus_from_Mariner_10.jpg" alt="Venus">
            <p class="planet-desc">Venus is the second planet from the sun and is the hottest planet in the solar system. 
                Its thick atmosphere is extremely toxic and composed of sulfuric acid clouds, the planet is an 
                extreme example of the greenhouse effect.</p>

            <h2>Earth</h2>
            <img class="planet-image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/The_Blue_Marble_%28remastered%29.jpg" alt="Earth">
            <p class="planet-desc">Earth, our home planet, is the third planet from the sun. It is a water world with two-thirds 
                of the planet covered by water. Earth's atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen and it is 
                the only world known to harbor life. </p>
            
            <h2>Mars</h2>
            <img class="planet-image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/OSIRIS_Mars_true_color.jpg/1200px-OSIRIS_Mars_true_color.jpg" alt="Mars">
            <p class="planet-desc">Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is a cold, desert-like planet covered in iron oxide 
                dust that gives the planet its signature red hue. Mars shares similarities with Earth: 
                It is rocky, has mountains, valleys and canyons, and storm systems ranging from localized 
                tornado-like dust devils to planet-engulfing dust storms. </p>
